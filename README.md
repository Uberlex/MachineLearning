# Introduction
DAT2025-Introduction to Machine Learning Portfolio - Assignments, Projects, Notes, and Lectures

---
This class took place in the Spring Semester of 2023, January 19 to May 9. During this course, our instructor Adam Forland led the curriculum more as the head of a professional working group rather than a traditional classroom. For this reason, myself and my classmates were given the opportunity to create, examine, and experiement with a variety of projects and tools relevant to topics such as data clustering, visualization, and gradient descent. We also explored the layouts, components, and functions of neural networks such as CNNs, DNNs, evolutionary algorithms, keras, and tensorflow. All programs in this portfolio are written in Python and orignally imported from our central Jupyter Notebook data lab that we used to conduct all our research and assignments throughout the semester. Course activities will be divided into a series of folders, similar in a manner to our datalab. Lectures by our instructor will be presented in the form of organized notes I took during the session to better understand and process the information. Assignments completed as homework will be placed in their own folder of the same name. Every concept covered in each homework assignment will be discussed in-depth with a portfolio page.
